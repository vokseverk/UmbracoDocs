# Running Umbraco on a Mac
*To run a local installation of Umbraco on a Mac you need to setup a VM that runs Microsoft Windows.*

### Boot Camp
Boot Camp is native VM software for macOS. See how to install Windows with Boot Camp [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468).

### Parallels
Parallels is third party and enables integration between macOS and Windows, i.e. running Windows Apps from the dock. Get it [here](https://www.parallels.com).

When your VM is running Windows, follow the instructions for [installing Umbraco](index.md).

### VMware Fusion
VMware Fusion is a third party virtualization software which can be used to run Windows on your Mac. Get it [here](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html). Just like with Parallels you should follow these [install instructions for Umbraco](index.md) after you have Windows installed.
